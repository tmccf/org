<h2>THE FORUM</h2>
<p>The TARABA MUSLIMS AND CHRISTIAN'S CONSULTATIVE FORUM 
Established mutual dialogue and conflict resolution between Muslims and 
Christians in Nigeria (dust) principles that were not fed up with 
the people of previous religions, and were not fanatical without 
the various opinions and doctrines, but its Almighty saying: So he 
preached to worshipers. Those who listen to the saying and 
follow the best of it) (Al-Zumar 18 For this purpose, it was among 
the principles of both religions: Religious Tolerance:
1 - That all the divine religions derive from one particular: God Almighty 
said: “No religion has been passed on to you from what God 
commanded, and which we have revealed to you, and what we 
have commanded, through Abraham, and Abraham, and Abraham,
2 - and that the prophets are brothers do not differentiate between them 
in terms of the message, and that the people of religions to believe 
in all of them: God said: Luau We believe in Allah and what was 
revealed to us and what was revealed to Abraham and Ishmael 
and Isaac and Jacob and the tribes, and that given to Moses and 
Jesus, and that given to the prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction Between one of them and we are Muslims (136) Al-
Baqara
3 - And that the belief cannot be coerced, but rather that it must be 
persuasive and contented. God Almighty said: There is no 
compulsion in religion} Al-Baqarah {So do you hate people until 
they are believers} Yunus
4 - And that the places of worship for divine religions are respected and 
must be defended and protected for all the people of religions: 
God Almighty said: Were it not for God to pay people with one 
another, silos, silos, and whims of rituals would be destroyed.
5 - And that people whose differences in their religions should not lead to 
killing each other, or transgressing one another, but rather must 
cooperate in doing good and combating evil: God Almighty said: 
And cooperate with righteousness and piety, and do not help with 
help. 2)
6 - And that the differentiation between people in life and with God is the 
amount of good and righteousness that one of them offers to 
himself and to people, and Al-Tabarani narrated: From God’s 
servant, he said: The Messenger of God, may God’s prayers and 
peace be upon him, said: “All of them are God’s creatures. God 
Almighty: {I honor you with God, may God protect you}
7 - and that the difference in religions does not preclude land and related 
hospitality: God said: day lawful to you the good things and the 
food of those given the book to you and yours is lawful to them 
and chaste women from the believers and chaste women from 
those who were given the Book before you table 5}
8 - And if people differ in their religions, they may argue with each other 
in a good way, and within the limits of literature, argument and 
persuasion: God Almighty said: Do not argue with the people of
the Book except with what is better. Spider 46
Indecency is not permissible with violators, nor can their creeds be 
insulted, even if they are pagans: God Almighty said: Do not deny 
those who pray without God, and they cursin
9 - If the nation is assaulted in its creed, aggression must be returned to 
protect the faith and ward off strife: God Almighty said: Fight 
them until they are not temptation and all religion is for God} Al-Anfal 39
God Almighty said: “May God forbade you from those who have fought 
you in religion, and drive you out of your homes, and make sure 
that yours is lost.”
10 - If a nation triumphs over those who assaulted it in religion, or wants 
to rob it of its freedom, it is not permissible to take revenge on 
them by forcing them to leave their religion, or persecuting them 
in their beliefs, and it is only for them to recognize the authority of 
the state and establish loyalty to it so that (they have what we 
have and what they have for us.

<h2>SOME ACTIVITIES OF THE FORUM</h2>
<p>1 Interfaith dialogue
The communication, dialogue and cooperation between different faiths 
and religious groups.
This Organization aims to promote respect and collaboration between 
different faiths and religions. As well as the Organization there are 
several councils that work predominantly in the Nigeria and have 
a focus on relationships between particular religions.
2 Intercultural dialogues
"Occurs when members of different cultural groups, who hold conflicting 
opinions and assumptions, speak to one another in 
acknowledgment of those differences".[1] It builds upon the 
concept of dialogue, which refers to at least two people holding a 
conversation. And it builds upon the term intercultural, which is 
typically used to refer to people communicating across differences 
in nationality, race and ethnicity, or religion.
3 peace building
Peace building seeks to address the underlying causes of conflict, helping 
people to resolve their differences peacefully and lay the 
foundations to 
We need to think differently – it’s time we stopped picking up the pieces 
and started putting an end to the cycles of violence. It’s time we 
invested more in peace building.
4 Conflict transformations

A generic, comprehensive term referring to actions and processes seeking 
to alter the various characteristics and manifestations of violent 
conflict by addressing the root causes of a particular conflict over 
the long term. It aims to transform negative destructive conflict 
into positive constructive conflict and deals with structural, 
behavioral and attitudinal aspects of conflict. The term refers to 
both the process and the completion of the process. As such, it 
incorporates the activities of processes such as conflict prevention 
and conflict resolution and goes farther than conflict settlement 
or conflict Management
5 humanitarian actions
the humanitarian that it is an impartial and independent assessment of 
needs—not a development plan—that determines what needs to 
be done. Humanitarian action may in some cases de facto fit in a 
development plan, but it is not determined by it. Importantly, 
humanitarian actors will prioritize addressing humanitarian 
needs even if the potential development dividends appear slim. 
From a humanitarian perspective, investing in a hospital that risks 
being damaged by fighting is still worth it: measures can be taken 
to reduce risks to the facility and meanwhile hundreds of lives can 
be saved.
6 advocacy 
As a tool for
Putting a problem on the agenda, providing a solution to that 
problem and building support for acting on both the problem and 
the solution”. This definition expresses an important idea: In a 
digital and networked age, advocacy is not just about influencing 
public policy, but also and first of all about influencing public 
opinion.</p>

<h2>Five pillars of religion principles</h2>

<p>The principles of Sharia in the religion of the prophets, which are the 
interests of religion and the world, so that if you lose, the interests 
of the world will not make you straight, but rather corruption, 
sloppiness and a life.
1- Keeping the human soul
Because of that We ordained for the Children of Israel: that whoever kills 
a person—unless it is for murder or corruption on earth—it is as 
if he killed the whole of mankind; and whoever saves it, it is as if 

he saved the whole of mankind. Our messengers came to them 
with clarifications, but even after that, many of them continue to 
commit excesses in the land. Alma’ida(32) 
2- Keeping the worship 
Permission is given to those who are fought against, and God is Able to 
give them victory.
Those who were unjustly evicted from their homes, merely for saying, 
“Our Lord is God.” Were it not that God repels people by means of 
others: monasteries, churches, synagogues, and mosques—where 
the name of God is mentioned much—would have been 
demolished. God supports whoever supports Him. God is Strong 
and Mighty. Al-Haj (40 ) 
3- Save money
When he gains power, he strives to spread corruption on earth, destroying 
properties and lives. God does not like corruption. Baqara (205) 
4- Keeping the mind
And God Almighty always warns a person to receive matters with his 
mind, his mind, his reflection and his remembrance, because his 
glory knows that if a person thinks, minds, remembers or 
manages, he will end up with the same issue that pushes him from 
harm and brings him benefit, and all that is in the universe is a 
machine for the mind
In the creation of the heavens and the earth; in the alternation of night 
and day; in the ships that sail the oceans for the benefit of 
mankind; in the water that God sends down from the sky, and 
revives the earth with it after it had died, and scatters in it all 
kinds of creatures; in the changing of the winds, and the clouds 
disposed between the sky and the earth; are signs for people who 
understand. Baqara (164) 
5- Keeping offspring
Those who accuse chaste women, then cannot bring four witnesses, whip 
them eighty lashes, and do not ever accept their testimony. For 
these are the immoral.

5. Except for those who repent afterwards, and reform; for God is 
Forgiving and Merciful. Annur (5) 
 SHEIKH MUSA ALIYU
 CHAIRMAN</p>


<h2>The ten Commandment</h2>
<p>These orders are agreed upon in all messages and in all religions, and they call it: “The 
Ten Commandments” are the essentials of spiritual life, they are the essentials of life 
from values
151. Say, “Come, let me tell you what your Lord has forbidden you: that you associate 
nothing with Him; that you honor your parents; that you do not kill your children 
because of poverty—We provide for you and for them; that you do not come near 
indecencies, whether outward or inward; and that you do not kill the soul which God 
has sanctified—except in the course of justice. All this He has enjoined upon you, so 
that you may understand.”
152. And do not come near the property of the orphan, except with the best 
intentions, until he reaches maturity. And give full weight and full measure, equitably. </p>
